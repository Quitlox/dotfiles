# PipeWire Sample Rate Configuration
#
# Problem: Audio crackling when playing music through monitor headphone jack
# Cause: Firefox outputs audio at 44.1kHz, but hardware was locked to 48kHz.
#        PipeWire was doing real-time sample rate conversion (resampling),
#        causing audible artifacts (crackling/ticking sounds).
#
# Solution: Allow PipeWire to switch the hardware sample rate dynamically
#           to match the source material, eliminating resampling artifacts.
#
# Sample rates explained:
#   44100 Hz - CD quality, used by most music files and streaming services
#   48000 Hz - Professional audio/video standard, used by most system sounds
#   88200 Hz - High-res audio (2x CD quality)
#   96000 Hz - High-res audio/video standard
#
# With this configuration, PipeWire will automatically switch your audio
# hardware to the native sample rate of whatever is playing, providing
# bit-perfect audio without resampling.

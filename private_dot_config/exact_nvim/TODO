FIX:
    - Center cursor on "Go definition", etc.
    - vie (select inside environment) from vimtex should not select first line of env
        https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround/discussions/53#discussioncomment-5585321 ? 

    - investigate pop-up when ansible-language-server is installed via Mason and no config dir is present on the system
    - when navigating through completions, if the current completion item has doc and the next doesnt, and you go to the next, the doc of the prev remains visible

    - notify
        - stack notifications that are the same with a count
    - neotest
        - output window should be closable with q
        - g? should open keymap instructions for summary
        - command for running the last ran test
	- collapse empty directories like explorer
	- x in summary window should kill test
	- don't open quickfix
    - neotest python
	- should show all variants of a test (all combinations of fixtures, see vscode)
    - brackets don't auto align properly in lua
    - diffview and floats should be closeable with q

    	- lualine overwrite window bar
	- how to close all windows

    - replace which-key.register with default nvim api

COULD:
    - Switch over from nvm-cmp to coq

BLOCKED:
    - ]f in python should not go to decorator
    - python identation nvim-autopairs

Contribute (Existing projects):
    - Neogit has no explanation whatsover on how to use rebase
Contribute (My Ideas):
    - Plugin for a custom outline
      This custom outline starts empty, and allows you to add LSP objects with
      a keyboard shortcut
      Its basically a custom LSP jumplist/shortlist of important methods
      Very usefull when refactoring something in a new codebase / jumping around
      in a new codebase
    - Python:
        - Code action for generating test from function using pytest
        - Import thing under cursor
        - Proper environment switcher, supporting poetry, venv, virtualenv
    - UI frames library
        - Let user designed where NvimTree, symbol outline etc goes
        - Let user decide when these windows close, their precedence
        - Let user decide when visible (min widht)


Notes:
    - git diffview has a great example of how to do a help menu through g?

WIP: Moving over to Trello

- Replace null-ls with lint and format
- Instead of adding commands to legendary via lazy, how about adding all
  commands to a global variable during init and loading them once during setup?
- Legendary.nvim has many duplicates (e.g. gI, g0)

FIX:
    - vie (select inside environment) from vimtex should not select first line of env
        https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround/discussions/53#discussioncomment-5585321 ? 
    - typescript daf (delete around function) doesn't work
    - neotest python support for live logging
    - in lua (and ts/js I believe), when I do "ds{", surrounding commas should be deleted with as well
    - ]f in python should not go to decorator

TODO:
    - Add venv-selector to lualine

COULD:
    - Add hydra.nvim
    	- Use: for navigating git changes and stashing them

OPTIONAL PLUGINS: (might come in handy later)
    - Commandline: wilder.nvim (Customizable wildmenu, change completion and renderer)
    - Winbar: dropbar.nvim as a fancy replacement of navic.nvim
        I barely use navic so there's no point
    - Nested LSP: otter.nvim for lsp support inside embedded snippets (e.g. code block in markdown)
        Configuration not trivial
    - Completion: replace nvm-cmp with coq
      	Supposed to be much faster, but too much of a headache
	

Contribute (My Ideas):
    - Plugin for a custom outline
      This custom outline starts empty, and allows you to add LSP objects with
      a keyboard shortcut
      Its basically a custom LSP jumplist/shortlist of important methods
      Very usefull when refactoring something in a new codebase / jumping around
      in a new codebase
    - Python:
        - Code action for generating test from function using pytest
        - Import thing under cursor

Notes:
    - git diffview has a great example of how to do a help menu through g?

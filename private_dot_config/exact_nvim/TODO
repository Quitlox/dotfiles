FIX:
    - Center cursor on "Go definition", etc.
    - telescope should respect excludes in gitignore (!)
    - vie (select inside environment) from vimtex should not select first line of env
        https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround/discussions/53#discussioncomment-5585321 ? 
    - investigate pop-up when ansible-language-server is installed via Mason and no config dir is present on the system
    - highlights in git hunk preview could be nicer
    - neotest summary window should have keymap (or I need to manually map which-key)
    - when navigating through completions, if the current completion item has doc and the next doesnt, and you go to the next, the doc of the prev remains visible
    - output window of neotest should be closable with q

    - further configure oil 
        needs keybinding, should be lazy
    - replace (spectre) should become command not keybinding

COULD:
    - Switch over from nvm-cmp to coq

BLOCKED:
    - autopairs does not work for rust angular brackets
    https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs/blob/master/lua/nvim-autopairs/rules/basic.lua
    - flit.nvim does not support , and ;
    - ]f in python should not go to decorator

PLUGINS:
    - hydra.nvim ?
    - tsc.nvim: seamless async project-wide TypeScript

OPTIONAL PLUGINS: (might come in handy later)
    - harpoon.nvim / grapple.nvim
    - buffer_manager.nvim / JABS
    - neocomposer.nvim: simplifies macros enchaning productivity with harmony

Contribute (Existing projects):
    - Neogit has no explanation whatsover on how to use rebase
Contribute (My Ideas):
    - Plugin for a custom outline
      This custom outline starts empty, and allows you to add LSP objects with
      a keyboard shortcut
      Its basically a custom LSP jumplist/shortlist of important methods
      Very usefull when refactoring something in a new codebase / jumping around
      in a new codebase
    - Python:
        - Code action for generating test from function using pytest
        - Import thing under cursor
        - Proper environment switcher, supporting poetry, venv, virtualenv
    - UI frames library
        - Let user designed where NvimTree, symbol outline etc goes
        - Let user decide when these windows close, their precedence
        - Let user decide when visible (min widht)

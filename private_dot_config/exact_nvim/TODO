FIX:
    - vie (select inside environment) from vimtex should not select first line of env
        https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround/discussions/53#discussioncomment-5585321 ? 
    - typescript daf (delete around function) doesn't work
    - neotest python support for live logging
    - in lua (and ts/js I believe), when I do "ds{", surrounding commas should be deleted with as well

COULD:
    - Replace nvm-cmp with coq
    	- Should be faster
    - Replace LSPSaga with:
    	- Code Action Menu: nvim-code-action-menu
    - Replace navic with dropdown.nvim
    - Add Notebook Navigator
    	- If I want to use VSCode Cell like functionality
    - dap-utils.nvim
    	- Once I figure out session management,
	I should incorporate this
    - Copilot.lua
    	- Replacement of Copilot.nvim if it gets slow
    - Add overseer.nvim
    	- For running tasks, supports vscode.json
	- Could be use to launch and restart docker containers
    - nvim-projector
	- Better project-specifc configs for nvim-dap with telescope!
    - Add one-small-step-for-vimkind
    	- Debugger for Neovim plugins, will be usefull for development of plugins
    - Add alpha-nvim
    	- As dashboard. But I should first settle on a "project"  solution
    - Add hydra.nvim
    	- Use: for navigating git changes and stashing them
    - Replace projections with persisted.nvim as session manager and conduct.nvim as project manager
    - Add NeoComposer for better Macro experience
    	Tried it: It would be a better UX, but there's bugs preventing me from using it
    - Add other.nvim for alternative files
    	Use-case: Switching between test and file
    - Add otter.nvim for snippet lsp support
    	Use-case: Wanting completion in markdown etc.
    - Add vim-dadbod
        Fugitive like solution for Databases from t-pope. If I every need to make changes to a database by hand
    - sphinx.nvim
     	For sphinx support
	Unfortunately it seems unmaintained

BLOCKED:
    - ]f in python should not go to decorator
    - python identation nvim-autopairs
    	- https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/y9qkks/problem_with_python_identation_when_using/
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/13d3hy5/different_autopair_indentation_on_cr_in_python/
    - edgy.nvim
	- how to close all windows

OPTIONAL PLUGINS: (might come in handy later)
    - Command
        wilder.nvim (Customizable wildmenu, change completion and renderer)
        live-command.nvim
    - Telescope:
    	- telescope-docker
	- session-lens
	- telescope-repo

Contribute (My Ideas):
    - Plugin for a custom outline
      This custom outline starts empty, and allows you to add LSP objects with
      a keyboard shortcut
      Its basically a custom LSP jumplist/shortlist of important methods
      Very usefull when refactoring something in a new codebase / jumping around
      in a new codebase
    - Python:
        - Code action for generating test from function using pytest
        - Import thing under cursor
        - Proper environment switcher, supporting poetry, venv, virtualenv
    - UI frames library
        - Let user designed where NvimTree, symbol outline etc goes
        - Let user decide when these windows close, their precedence
        - Let user decide when visible (min widht)


Notes:
    - git diffview has a great example of how to do a help menu through g?

FIX:
    - vie (select inside environment) from vimtex should not select first line of env
        https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround/discussions/53#discussioncomment-5585321 ? 

    - neotest
        - g? should open keymap instructions for summary
        - command for running the last ran test
	- collapse empty directories like explorer

    - do nvim-surround.nvim and nvim-autotag conflict for html?
    - yank highlight

    - typescript daf (delete around function) doesn't work

COULD:
    - Replace nvm-cmp with coq
    	- Should be faster
    - Replace LSPSage with:
    	- Code Action Menu: nvim-code-action-menu
    - Replace navic with dropdown.nvim
    - Replace projections with persisted.nvim as session manager and conduct.nvim as project manager
    - Add NeoComposer for better Macro experience
    	Tried it: It would be a better UX, but there's bugs preventing me from using it
    - Add other.nvim for alternative files
    	Use-case: Switching between test and file
    - Add otter.nvim for snippet lsp support
    	Use-case: Wanting completion in markdown etc.

BLOCKED:
    - ]f in python should not go to decorator
    - python identation nvim-autopairs
    	- https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/y9qkks/problem_with_python_identation_when_using/
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/13d3hy5/different_autopair_indentation_on_cr_in_python/
    - edgy.nvim
	- how to close all windows

OPTIONAL PLUGINS: (might come in handy later)
    - Command
        wilder.nvim (Customizable wildmenu, change completion and renderer)
        live-command.nvim
    - Tasks
    	overseer.nvim

    - Telescope:
    	- telescope-docker
	- session-lens
	- telescope-repo

Contribute (Existing projects):
    - Neogit has no explanation whatsover on how to use rebase
Contribute (My Ideas):
    - Plugin for a custom outline
      This custom outline starts empty, and allows you to add LSP objects with
      a keyboard shortcut
      Its basically a custom LSP jumplist/shortlist of important methods
      Very usefull when refactoring something in a new codebase / jumping around
      in a new codebase
    - Python:
        - Code action for generating test from function using pytest
        - Import thing under cursor
        - Proper environment switcher, supporting poetry, venv, virtualenv
    - UI frames library
        - Let user designed where NvimTree, symbol outline etc goes
        - Let user decide when these windows close, their precedence
        - Let user decide when visible (min widht)


Notes:
    - git diffview has a great example of how to do a help menu through g?

FIX:
    - Center cursor on "Go definition", etc.
    - on opening previous session, buffer is opened in nvimtree window
    - telescope should respect excludes in gitignore (!)
    - chatgpt should work
    - vie (select inside environment) from vimtex should not select first line of env
    - nvim tree should not track COMMITMSG in .git directory
    - investigate pop-up when ansible-language-server is installed via Mason and no config dir is present on the system
    - highlights in git hunk preview could be nicer
    - session still broken, very annoying
    - I need a plugin to preview markdown files, as I need to check whether or
    not I fucked up the formatting of a README file

COULD:
    - Add more options for bracket navigation: mini.bracketed
    - Switch over from nvm-cmp to coq

BLOCKED:
    - Neogit leaves empty window when Neogit is called inside a non-git directory (PR Opened!)

    - fix grouping of legendary keymaps (add plugin prefix to each description)
    - autopairs does not work for rust angular brackets
    - DapUI Highlight current line when paused. No clue how.
    - flit.nvim does not support , and ;
    - ]f in python should not go to decorator

    - dirbuf.nvim: Use vim to edit files and directories ALT: oil.nvim
    - hydra.nvim ?

    - nable.nvim: Render Math Equations in LaTeX as ASCII

Contribute (Existing projects):
    - Neogit has no explanation whatsover on how to use rebase
    - LspSaga
        - Show References window does not work well on halfscreen
Contribute (My Ideas):
    - Plugin for a custom outline
      This custom outline starts empty, and allows you to add LSP objects with
      a keyboard shortcut
      Its basically a custom LSP jumplist/shortlist of important methods
      Very usefull when refactoring something in a new codebase / jumping around
      in a new codebase
    - Python:
        - Code action for generating test from function using pytest
        - Import thing under cursor
        - Proper environment switcher, supporting poetry, venv, virtualenv
    - UI frames library
        - Let user designed where NvimTree, symbol outline etc goes
        - Let user decide when these windows close, their precedence
        - Let user decide when visible (min widht)

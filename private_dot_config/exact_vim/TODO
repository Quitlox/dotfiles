FIX:
    - Update highlights related to completion menu
        ```https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/wiki/Menu-Appearance```

    - Add keybinding for LspOutline
    - Ensure LspOutline does not resize when switching buffers

    - Go references not opened in LspSaga
    - Center cursor on "Go definition", etc.
    - ]f in python should not go to decorator

COULD:
    - Add shortcut for closing "other" windows (like jumplist)
    - More intuitive keys for resizing windows
    - Add more options for bracket navigation: mini.bracketed
    - Setup automatic installation of dap
    - Switch over from NvimTree to NeoTree

BLOCKED:
    - Neogit leaves empty window when Neogit is called inside a non-git
    directory. No clue how to fix
    - DapUI Highlight current line when paused. No clue how.
    - flit.nvim does not support , and ;

PLUGINS:
    - dirbuf.nvim: Use vim to edit files and directories ALT: oil.nvim
    - neotest
    - hydra.nvim ?
    - noice.nvim: Pretty UI

    -- nable.nvim: Render Math Equations in LaTeX as ASCII
    -- lsplines

OPTIONAL PLUGINS: (might come in handy later)
    -- harpoon.nvim / grapple.nvim
    -- buffer_manager.nvim

NEOVIM 0.9:
    - statuscol.nvim

Contribute (My Ideas):
    - Plugin for a custom outline
      This custom outline starts empty, and allows you to add LSP objects with
      a keyboard shortcut
      Its basically a custom LSP jumplist/shortlist of important methods
      Very usefull when refactoring something in a new codebase / jumping around
      in a new codebase
    - Python:
        - Code action for generating test from function using pytest
        - Import thing under cursor
        - Proper environment switcher, supporting poetry, venv, virtualenv
    - LspSaga
        - Show References window does not work well on halfscreen

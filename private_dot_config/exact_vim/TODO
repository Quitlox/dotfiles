FIX:
    - Center cursor on "Go definition", etc.
    - on opening previous session, buffer is opened in nvimtree window
    - Latex files should always be softwrap    
        - but why does it not detect that latex like files should be softwrap?
    - telescope should respect excludes in gitignore (!)
    - add ]n [n for navigating to notes
    - map <space>oe to vimtex outline in latex
    - chatgpt should work
    - yanklist / history
    - vie (select inside environment) from vimtex should not select first line of env
    - nvim tree should not track COMMITMSG in .git directory
    - investigate popup when ansible-language-server is installed via Mason and no config directory is present on the system

COULD:
    - Add more options for bracket navigation: mini.bracketed
    - Switch over from nvm-cmp to coq

BLOCKED:
    - Neogit leaves empty window when Neogit is called inside a non-git
    directory. No clue how to fix
    - DapUI Highlight current line when paused. No clue how.
    - flit.nvim does not support , and ;
    - ]f in python should not go to decorator

PLUGINS:
    - dirbuf.nvim: Use vim to edit files and directories ALT: oil.nvim
    - hydra.nvim ?

    - nable.nvim: Render Math Equations in LaTeX as ASCII
    - lsplines

    - tsc.nvim: seamless async project-wide TypeScript
    - neocomposer.nvim: simplifies macros enchaning productivity with harmony

    -- buffer_manager.nvim

Contribute (My Ideas):
    - Plugin for a custom outline
      This custom outline starts empty, and allows you to add LSP objects with
      a keyboard shortcut
      Its basically a custom LSP jumplist/shortlist of important methods
      Very usefull when refactoring something in a new codebase / jumping around
      in a new codebase
    - Python:
        - Code action for generating test from function using pytest
        - Import thing under cursor
        - Proper environment switcher, supporting poetry, venv, virtualenv
    - LspSaga
        - Show References window does not work well on halfscreen
    - UI frames library
        - Let user designed where NvimTree, symbol outline etc goes
        - Let user decide when these windows close, their precedence
        - Let user decide when visible (min widht)
        - UI should be split in Main (editor) and Sidebars (left, right, bottom)
    - Overleaf Plugin
        - Including viewing of cursor

TODO:
- fix grouping of legendary keymaps (add plugin prefix to each description)

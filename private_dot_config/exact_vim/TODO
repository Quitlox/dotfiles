TODO:
    - Create confirmation dialog on quit if terminal still running
    - sequence "ci)" => should change inside next parathesis (instead of the
    current, which is kinda the previous)

FIX:
    - Open Git Status errors if not git repo
    - Error when ctags not installed, should be a kind notification
    - Python autosnippets should not activate in comments

    - [ ] Autocomplete in DAP-UI REPL: cmp-dap
    - [ ] Resize NvimTree on DapUI close (too wide)
    - [ ] DapUI Highlight current line when paused

    - [ ] Vi keys do not work well with floating terminal
    - [ ] Add mapping for Neogit
    - [ ] Add Git Blame plugin
    - [ ] Add JSON Navigator plugin

COULD:
    - More intuitive keys for resizing windows
    - Choice node for tex snippet \beg (for adding [])
    - Enable virtual-type for languages
    - Replace WhichKey spell correction with completion-type menu

    - Update highlights related to completion menu
